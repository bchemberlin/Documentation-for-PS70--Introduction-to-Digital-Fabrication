<strong>Final Project Proposal</strong>
<p>For my final project, I would like to create an interactive map that allows users 
to engage with land-based history in North America. I am not sure exactly how this could work, but it would be really cool to 
create a sort of map using 3D printing and other media to reflect landmarks or topography, and then store information 
(audio? illuminated portions? something else?) in a microcontroller or microprocessor. It would be interesting to record audio to 
explain the significance of landmarks or regions that audience members could select. It would also be amazing to use lighting or 
some other method to show some parts of the map while erasing other parts. I don't know if this will be possible, but I love 
using maps to tell stories and spend a lot of time researching them, so making a physical, functional, interactive mapping 
experience about a territory I care about would be really powerful.</p>
