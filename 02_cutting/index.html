<h1>2D design and cutting, Vinyl cutter/Laser cutter>
<p>For this week, the assignment was to create a press fit construction kit. I wanted to create a tree-like structure that could
  be reconfigured and have leaves or elements added or subtracted. The plan was to use a round base into which four "branches" or 
  "trunks" could be inserted, and then create smaller circles that could be stuck onto the curved branches in different arrangements.
  I had never worked in Fusion 360 or used a laser cutter before, so this was a challenge, but I made a few different designs to 
  to experiment. At first, I made a small model, both because I wanted to practice without wasting much material, and also because
  I did not expect the scale to be so small and it was partially accidental. On this model, I learned that the kerf was a bit more than 
  what I had assumed at first (0.2) and the width was on average smaller than 4.2, so in subsequent iterations, I set the width to be 
  smaller (4.0) and increased the kerf to 0.4 mm.</p>
